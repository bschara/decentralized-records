Decentralized Medical Record Project
Overview

Welcome to the Decentralized Medical Record Project! This project aims to revolutionize the way medical records are stored and accessed by utilizing blockchain technology in a decentralized fashion. By combining both off-chain and on-chain storage solutions, we ensure that patient medical data is secure, private, and readily accessible while emphasizing interoperability and client data ownership.
